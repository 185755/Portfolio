## ðŸ“Œ Projects

### 1. Project Name
**Description:**  
I wonâ€™t hide the fact that this repository was created as a summary of all my projects to present them better. At the beginning of my studies, I worked on many projects, but I didnâ€™t use a GitHub repository while creating them. It was only later that I started using it, but the projects didnâ€™t look very presentable. To fill in the gaps and improve my GitHub skills, I created this repository to gather all my projects in one place for better presentation.
