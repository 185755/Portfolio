## 🚀 About Me
I won’t hide the fact that this repository was created as a summary of all my projects to present them better. At the beginning of my studies, I worked on many projects, but I didn’t use a GitHub repository while creating them. It was only later that I started using it, but the projects didn’t look very presentable. To fill in the gaps and improve my GitHub skills, I created this repository to gather all my projects in one place for better presentation.

## 📌 Projects

### 1. Project Name: AI System for Verifying Soft Skills
**Description:**  
My flagship project is a research project titled: "AI System for Verifying Soft Skills Based on Generative Artificial Intelligence for Task Creation in ACDC Sessions." The goal of this project was to develop a program that would generate tasks for AC/DC sessions.

(AC/DC sessions are a method used to assess and reinforce traits that demonstrate the possession of soft skills.)

However, during the development of the project, the concept was modified, and the focus was limited to assessing candidates using artificial intelligence. To achieve this, APIs from Hugging Face and OpenAI were utilized to access best LLMs.

The project's objective was to compare whether a program using pre-trained LLMs could match— and ultimately replace— a qualified assessor in evaluating candidates' soft skills.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python, HuggingFace, OpenAI, openpyxl, whisper, MistralAI, 3.5turbo,	o1mini,	4omini,	Qwen, Llama 70B, Llama 3B, transformers, prompt engineering, django, Google Drive API, 
 

**Key Features:**  
- 🔹 _Feature 1_  - Task for the user: Record 3 short videos (max 3 minutes each) and upload them to Google Drive.
- 🔹 _Feature 2_  - A program for downloading and transcribing videos. The program fetched MP4 files from the drive and then used AI models to transcribe them into TXT files.
- 🔹 _Feature 3_  - The text files were then used as part of the prompt for the model, which subsequently generated the final evaluation of the candidate.
