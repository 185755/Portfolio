## 🚀 About Me
I won’t hide the fact that this repository was created as a summary of all my projects to present them better. At the beginning of my studies, I worked on many projects, but I didn’t use a GitHub repository while creating them. It was only later that I started using it, but the projects didn’t look very presentable. To fill in the gaps and improve my GitHub skills, I created this repository to gather all my projects in one place for better presentation.

## 📌 Projects

### 1. Project Name: AI System for Verifying Soft Skills
**Description:**  
My flagship project is a research project titled: "AI System for Verifying Soft Skills Based on Generative Artificial Intelligence for Task Creation in ACDC Sessions." The goal of this project was to develop a program that would generate tasks for AC/DC sessions.

(AC/DC sessions are a method used to assess and reinforce traits that demonstrate the possession of soft skills.)

However, during the development of the project, the concept was modified, and the focus was limited to assessing candidates using artificial intelligence. To achieve this, APIs from Hugging Face and OpenAI were utilized to access best LLMs.

The project's objective was to compare whether a program using pre-trained LLMs could match— and ultimately replace— a qualified assessor in evaluating candidates' soft skills.

**Technologies Used:**  
- Python, HuggingFace, OpenAI, openpyxl, whisper, MistralAI, 3.5turbo,	o1mini,	4omini,	Qwen, Llama 70B, Llama 3B, transformers, prompt engineering, django, Google Drive API, 
 

**Key Features:**  
- 🔹 _Feature 1_  - Task for the user: Record 3 short videos (max 3 minutes each) and upload them to Google Drive.
- 🔹 _Feature 2_  - A program for downloading and transcribing videos. The program fetched MP4 files from the drive and then used AI models to transcribe them into TXT files.
- 🔹 _Feature 3_  - The text files were then used as part of the prompt for the model, which subsequently generated the final evaluation of the candidate.

### 3. Project Name: Weather Data Analytics for Disaster Management
**Description:**  
This project analyzes real-time and historical weather data to detect anomalies and predict potential disasters such as heatwaves. It uses **Apache Kafka** for real-time data streaming, **Apache Spark** for distributed data processing, and **AWS EMR** for scalable infrastructure. The system aims to provide insights for disaster management, including heatwave detection and predictive modeling.

**Technologies Used:**  
- **Apache Kafka**: Real-time data streaming.  
- **Apache Spark**: Batch and stream processing (MLlib integration attempted).  
- **AWS EMR**: Hosting Spark clusters and S3 for storage.  
- **Python**: Programming language.  
- **Open-Meteo API**: Source for real-time and historical weather data.  

**Key Features:**  
- 🔹 Real-time weather streaming using Kafka.  
- 🔹 Heatwave detection and analysis based on historical temperature data.  
- 🔹 Integration with AWS EMR for scalable data processing and storage.

### 4. Project Name: Impulse Noise Removal from Music Recordings

**Description:**
My second most important project is my master’s thesis, which is focused on impulse noise removal from music recordings. It utilizes an autoregressive (AR) model combined with the Exponentially Weighted Least Squares (EW-LS) algorithm for efficient parameter estimation. The goal is to remove impulse noise while maintaining the integrity of the audio signal.

**Technologies Used:**
- MATLAB(for computational implementation)
- Autoregressive (AR) Model
- Exponentially Weighted Least Squares (EW-LS) Algorithm
- Linear Interpolation

**Key Features:**
- 🔹 Impulse Noise Removal: Effectively detects and removes impulse noise from audio signals.  
- 🔹 AR Model for Signal Dynamics: Uses a 4th-order AR model to represent the signal's local dynamics.  
- 🔹 Real-Time Processing: Adaptable for real-time audio processing with parameter estimation and noise detection.
